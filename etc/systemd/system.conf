# Entries in this file show the compile time defaults. Local configuration
# should be created by either modifying this file (or a copy of it placed in
# /etc/ if the original file is shipped in /usr/), or by creating "drop-ins" in
# /etc/systemd/system.conf.d/ directory. The latter is generally recommended.
# Defaults can be restored by simply deleting the main configuration file and
# all drop-ins located in /etc/.
#
# Use 'systemd-analyze cat-config systemd/system.conf' to display the full config.
